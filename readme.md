As a user:

1) I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list that contains a title, url link, description and a rating between 1-5 stars

2) I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app under a condensed view but can be expanded by clicking on it

3) The expanded view gives a more detailed view of the page that is bookmarked

4) I can remove bookmarks off the list

5) I receive appropriate feedback when I submit an error when trying to add a bookmark

6) I can select form a drop down menu to filter by minimium rating
